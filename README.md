# Simulation-Based Inference Hackathon 2026

Welcome to the **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) Hackathon 2026** — a three-day, hands-on event dedicated to exploring modern Bayesian inference tools for complex scientific simulators.

**📅 Dates:** 21-23 January 2026  
**📍 Location:** IMAG building, Université Grenoble Alpes campus, Grenoble, France
**🧩 Duration:** 3 days (1.5 days tutorial + 1.5 days hackathon)  
**👥 Target audience:** researchers, students, and practitioners interested in parameter estimation, model calibration, or uncertainty quantification in physical, biological, or engineering simulations.

## 🔍 Motivation

Many modern scientific problems rely on complex, stochastic simulators for which classical likelihood-based inference is intractable. **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)** provides a principled and efficient Bayesian framework to learn from such models — enabling posterior estimation and parameter calibration directly from simulated data.

This hackathon aims to lower the barrier for new users by combining a **guided tutorial** and an **open hack session** where participants apply SBI to their own problems.

## 📚 Structure

### **Day 1–2 (Tutorial, 1.5 days)**
Led by **[Jan Teusen](https://github.com/janfb)**. Topics include:
- Generative modeling and the SBI framework  
- Neural posterior estimation (NPE), likelihood and ratio estimation  
- Hands-on notebooks using the [`sbi`](https://github.com/mackelab/sbi) Python package  
- Applying SBI to toy and benchmark simulators

### **Day 2–3 (Hackathon, 1.5 days)**
Participants form small teams around real or toy simulators (your own, or provided examples).  
Possible directions:
- Adapting SBI to your research simulator  
- Benchmarking different inference strategies  
- Building reproducible pipelines for calibration or uncertainty quantification  
- Sharing and discussing results at the closing session

We will take inspiration from successful open hackathons such as the [IGE-Jaxathon 2025](https://github.com/Diff4Earth/ige-jaxathon-2025), emphasizing collaboration, openness, and applied research.
